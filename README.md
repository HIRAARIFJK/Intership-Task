Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the success of a bank marketing campaign, specifically whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit (deposit). Using the Bank Marketing Dataset, the project employs machine learning techniques such as data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation to address this binary classification problem.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables (label encoding and one-hot encoding)
Standardizing numeric features using StandardScaler
Feature Selection:
Correlation analysis
Mutual information scores
SelectKBest (ANOVA F-value)
Model Training:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Cross-validation (5-fold) for robust performance evaluation
Model Evaluation:
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
Feature importance ranking and interpretation
Dataset
The dataset contains customer details such as age, job, marital status, and previous marketing campaign outcomes, along with the target variable deposit. Ensure the dataset file (bank_marketing_dataset.csv) is located in the root directory of the project.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Required Python Libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Install dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Instructions to Run
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/bank-marketing-prediction.git
cd bank-marketing-prediction
Prepare the Environment: Ensure all dependencies are installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Project:

Open the BankMarketingCampaignPrediction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
Execute the cells step-by-step to process data, train models, and evaluate results.
Analyze Results:

Model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be displayed in the notebook.
Visualization of feature importance will help understand the impact of features on the prediction.
Results
The Random Forest model showed the best performance with an accuracy of 87% and an F1-score of 86%.
Top features impacting campaign success:
previous (number of contacts performed before the current campaign)
poutcome (outcome of the previous campaign)
contact (type of communication)
age
